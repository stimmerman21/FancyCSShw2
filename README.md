# FancyCSShw2

** Main Idea
This assignment was to gain an overall grasp of the inner workings of CSS. Multipe concepts were practiced and applied such as reponsive design and layout,Flexbox, and reset/revert functionality. Many of these things are the foundation of web design, and are essenial to programming.

For my portfolio page I truly focused in on repition and making sure I am solid with the content. Ive added multiple things like images, links, and design. I definitley stepped outside of my comfort zone and added some new stuff.
